Resilience calculator
====================

This program is intended to run the resilience indicator and draws most 
of the figures used in "Countriesâ€™ Socio-Economic Resilience to 
Natural Disasters" by Stephane Hallegatte, Mook Bangalore, and Adrien 
Vogt-Schilb. 
It comes with no warranty at all. 

Basic instructions: 

First all, you need a copy of ipython (find instructions for this part 
online). You have to know that I use python 3. The code won't run under 
python 2 without adjustments. 

To reproduce the figures in the paper 

1-download_wb_data.ipynb gets data from ASPIRE, WDI and FINDEX. 
2-comptue_res_ind.ipynb compiles the data and uses it to compute the 
resilience indicator. All the equations arein another file, 
res_ind_lib.py, and saves the results. 

After that, you can use: 
3-draw maps.ipynb to draw the maps. 
4-draw_plots.ipynb to draw... the plots. 

Drawing the scorecards requires 2 steps (also after steps 1 and 2): 
5-run compute_scorecards.ipynb This basically computes the derivative of 
risk and resilience wrt all the inputs 
6-run render_scorecards.ipynb. 
This does the actual drawing.
